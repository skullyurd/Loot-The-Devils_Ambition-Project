This project is no longer in progress, but the code is still here for back-up purposes. In this game you were supposed to steal from bad creatures. You have to attack them,
come back to your base, upgrade your equipment and base, go back to fight stronger enemies, get much better loot and repeat till you finish the end boss.

I might come back and work on the project again since I was so in love with the idea.
